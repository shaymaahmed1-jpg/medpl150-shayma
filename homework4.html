    <h1>Homework 4 Explanation</h1>

    <p> 	
			Both of my collages explore the social concept of over consumption and consumerism. I feel that these issues are at their peak in this age of social media and online influencing. For my first collage, almost all images are my own. The main focus of the collage are my Sonny Angel collectible figurines. These come from blind boxes (which are very addicting), and I centered my collage around them because I feel that collectibles like these are a huge part of over consumption these days. 
		Unnecessary trinkets like these have plagued the online world and so many teenage girls' rooms. I repeated the figurines to represent the act of over consumption. For the top and bottom line up of the figures, I added a hue/saturation adjustment layer, and to further change the colorway, I added the lighten blending mode to the bottom row and the multiply mode to the top. On the top and bottom of the collage, I created a border using an image of a dollar bill that I found online to emphasize my message. 
		The letters that I used to spell out “buy” were also found online, and I created symmetry with the words on the top left and bottom right. To make different colorways for the words, I used levels adjustment layers. The packaging on the bottom left and top right are my own images, and I used those to represent the waste that consumerism causes.

			My second collage expands on the issue of waste that is produced due to over consumption. For this project, all the images I used were found online. I grabbed an image of the Earth, and I brought an image of a landfill on top of it, and added a gradient to merge the two images. I also added the luminosity blending mode to the Earth, because I noticed it helped to bring out the darker, greener tones in the image, which made the transition to the landfill look cleaner. 
		This symbolizes the waste that we fill our world with because of this hyper-consumerism. I found an image of money falling, and I placed it behind the Earth to further convey my message. Lastly, I found letters that went with my color scheme, and I spelt out the word “waste” to represent both wasted money and the literal garbage as shown in the landfill. Throughout the creation of my two collages, my most used tools were the object selection tool and the polygonal lasso to cut out my images and add a jagged effect.
