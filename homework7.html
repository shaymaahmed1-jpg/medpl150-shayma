    <p> One of the reasons why I chose this image to recreate was because I really enjoyed how defined each grain of grass was in the original picture; so, I decided to take on the tedious challenge of drawing each blade of grass with the brush tool. I also liked the texture of the grass, so I tried to emulate it using the grain feature. Lastly, the sky and clouds in the original picture had an interesting gradient-like look, so I utilized the gradient tool to try and capture that look.
