<p>The first chapter of Susan Sontag's “On Photography,” led me to wonder and interpret how photography has shaped our understanding of the world, and the ways that we experience every moment. Photography has allowed me to capture so many moments in my life that I may have forgotten if I hadn’t had taken a picture. On the other hand, sometimes I find myself resisting the urge to grab a photo because I simply want to seize the moment. In today’s age, I feel that photography has, in some ways, had a negative effect on the way that we live in the moment. Nowadays, it’s easy to become so focused on getting the perfect photo for social media, rather than soaking in the beautiful landscape or delicious food that is in front of us. I can’t say that I haven’t fallen victim to this trend, and I do also recognize that for many people, including myself, taking pictures is a form of appreciating the moment and creating memories. 
However, this commitment to photography, like Sontag mentions, creates a struggle to decide what is worthy of capturing. In my life, I don’t have any guidelines for what deserves a photo or not, and I don’t believe anyone does. Whether or not I take out my camera is usually dependent on how I am experiencing that moment; if I’m very focused or enthralled I may forget, but if I am shocked or amazed I will surely jump to snap the picture. When I do take a picture, I cherish that picture and look back at it longing to be in that moment again, and that is what I love about photography. I love the nostalgic feeling that I get when I look at old photos, the feeling of my soul reaching out to the photo to be in that time again.
As someone who stays informed on current events, I have noticed how impactful photography has been during such difficult times around the world. For example, images from Gaza have helped bring awareness to the atrocities being committed, and have sparked outrage, especially amongst the younger generation. I view the ability to capture images to be empowering and uplifting. Images from around the globe have exposed atrocities and proved injustices occurring. Sontag speaks on a photo's power in providing indisputable evidence for an event, and I have observed that this ability has proven the importance of photography today. The way in which I would use photography to convey the concepts of our society is by capturing images of community gatherings, protests, city halls, and rallies to represent the need for togetherness as we navigate a dangerous political climate. Now more than ever, our communities are divided by extreme ideologies and policies, and our world needs change. I would compile these images in a video with an overlay of motivational speakers to promote action. I think photos often ground people in the reality that they refuse to believe, and this is exactly my intention with this project idea. People need to see to understand that action is needed.
The ability to take a picture is powerful, we as a people get to decide what should be seen and remembered. In my journey as a media maker, I hope to use this power to ignite change.</p>
