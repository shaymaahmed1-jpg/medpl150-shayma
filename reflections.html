<p>The first chapter of Susan Sontag's “On Photography,” led me to wonder and interpret how photography has shaped our understanding of the world, and the ways that we experience every moment. Photography has allowed me to capture so many moments in my life that I may have forgotten if I hadn’t had taken a picture. On the other hand, sometimes I find myself resisting the urge to grab a photo because I simply want to seize the moment. In today’s age, I feel that photography has, in some ways, had a negative effect on the way that we live in the moment. Nowadays, it’s easy to become so focused on getting the perfect photo for social media, rather than soaking in the beautiful landscape or delicious food that is in front of us. I can’t say that I haven’t fallen victim to this trend, and I do also recognize that for many people, including myself, taking pictures is a form of appreciating the moment and creating memories.</p> 

<p>However, this commitment to photography, like Sontag mentions, creates a struggle to decide what is worthy of capturing. In my life, I don’t have any guidelines for what deserves a photo or not, and I don’t believe anyone does. Whether or not I take out my camera is usually dependent on how I am experiencing that moment; if I’m very focused or enthralled I may forget, but if I am shocked or amazed I will surely jump to snap the picture. When I do take a picture, I cherish that picture and look back at it longing to be in that moment again, and that is what I love about photography. I love the nostalgic feeling that I get when I look at old photos, the feeling of my soul reaching out to the photo to be in that time again.</p>

<p>As someone who stays informed on current events, I have noticed how impactful photography has been during such difficult times around the world. For example, images from Gaza have helped bring awareness to the atrocities being committed, and have sparked outrage, especially amongst the younger generation. I view the ability to capture images to be empowering and uplifting. Images from around the globe have exposed atrocities and proved injustices occurring. Sontag speaks on a photo's power in providing indisputable evidence for an event, and I have observed that this ability has proven the importance of photography today. The way in which I would use photography to convey the concepts of our society is by capturing images of community gatherings, protests, city halls, and rallies to represent the need for togetherness as we navigate a dangerous political climate. Now more than ever, our communities are divided by extreme ideologies and policies, and our world needs change. I would compile these images in a video with an overlay of motivational speakers to promote action. I think photos often ground people in the reality that they refuse to believe, and this is exactly my intention with this project idea. People need to see to understand that action is needed.</p>

<p>The ability to take a picture is powerful, we as a people get to decide what should be seen and remembered. In my journey as a media maker, I hope to use this power to ignite change.</p>

<p> In her article “With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster,” Nesrine Malik dives into the terrible effects of the rise of AI generated content online. She explains how this content is affecting the political landscape, and the public's perception of political leaders and world issues. </p>

<p> AI videos have been starting to reach my feed lately, and I won’t lie, the videos of cats driving cars do get a chuckle out of me. But, it saddens me when I remember all the artists and comedians that are working hard to produce content that goes unnoticed because of AI. For a lot of people, AI provides comedic relief in the chaos of the world today, but it is clear that there are destructive short and long term effects to this. Malik discusses how generated content not only acts as an escape from reality, but also a “distortion” of it. </p>

<p>More specifically, Malik explores the ways in which AI content presents politics and political leaders. She examines the messages of this political content, which seem to be mainly conservative and fascist. Malik’s commentary helped me realize that a lot of the political AI generated content I have seen has been right-leaning and promoting conservative ideologies. I have noticed that AI generated content has been especially prevalent since President Trump has come into office again. The president himself has been sharing AI slop on his social media platform Truth Social, which is extremely harmful because of his credibility as a leader. </p>

<p>In her free time, my grandma loves to watch YouTube reels, and unfortunately her algorithm pushes so many AI generated videos to her. Just the other day, I heard her listening to a sensationalized story of how Senator John Kennedy dominated Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez in a debate. It bothers me to see her become consumed by this content and its messaging, but I do not want to make her feel like she’s been tricked. AI generated content and its effects are very difficult to navigate, especially as you see it take over the lives of people close to you, a sentiment that Malik shares as well. </p>

<p>Malik explains how AI content has become a new type of propaganda that politicians and governments around the world can use to spread misleading information. Similar to the video that had my grandma captivated, content that warps the reality of political situations and generates fake scenarios between politicians creates a very dangerous environment that rejects concrete facts. This type of media not only polarizes the public unnecessarily, but it makes it very difficult to discern real from fake. If one wants to seek real facts to clarify information they’ve received from AI content, they now have uncertainty and mistrust clouding their judgment. Nowadays, as a media consumer you must be hyper-aware of what you are consuming to be careful not to fall for mis/disinformation.</p>

<p>Many people are becoming desensitized to the very real crises that our world is facing right now because of AI generated content that makes these situations feel less serious. Malik expands on this idea, emphasizing that the relief that AI provides from the stressful state of the world turns into disassociation from reality and a lack of “sense of urgency” to act for these crises. AI slop has gotten out of hand, and I don’t see any signs of it getting better. </p>

<p>I chose to analyze the use of photography, illustrations, and text in the graphic novel, “Kadiatu: The grieving mother, ‘The devil at my door.’” The story follows a woman named Kadiatu from Sierra Leone, and her struggles with pregnancy, birth, and the loss of seven children. For the majority of the story, illustrations are presented to describe the horrific and traumatizing events that Kadiatu endured. Viewers are transported to her setting with the collage-like panels where an illustration is placed on top of a real picture of her neighborhood. Kadiatu faced ridicule and judgement from her community for her struggles as a mother, and the text bubbles aided in imagining the actual dialogue that caused so much damage to her. The illustrations craft a narrative that would’ve otherwise not have held the same weight if they were merely photographs of reenactments. The illustrations create a painful visualization of Kadiatu in her weakest moments; one in particular focused on her with a cloud of darkness surrounding her that seemed to represent a depressive state. The overall use of depth, darkness, and light in the illustrations helped to tell a story of power, despair, and hope. However, I didn’t realize what was missing until the abrupt switch to just photographs and text happened. I was able to humanize the story once I saw the real faces of the people who were just characters in my mind. The photographs allowed me to place the story in its context and environment, making it more raw and emotional. Whether an illustration or photograph, a visual element is key to a story like this so that consumers are able to picture the scene in their mind. A piece with only text would severely lack the emotional element that is present in this graphic novel. Similarly, something with only a visual element has the potential to raise confusion and misinterpretation that text can resolve. The mix of photography, illustrations, and text all worked together to convey a truly heartbreaking story. </p>
