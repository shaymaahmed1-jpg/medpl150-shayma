<p> When I was a little girl, I loved detailing my days and writing about the joys of my little life in my pink diary. Today, I’m an aspiring journalist and writer. As I build on my portfolio, I intend to feature pieces that analyze and deconstruct trends of the social scene. Growing up in New York City, I’ve always been surrounded by a lively community, bursting at the seams with culture and all forms of art. I like to spend time in Central Park, watching the people go by and scanning the crowd for indications of the latest trends in beauty, fashion, fitness, and more. Being a Muslim, I grew up with very limited options for Halal food in NYC. Now, I’m fascinated by the growing number of multi-cultural Halal spots all over the city. I want to feature these eateries in my writing and help the Halal scene further expand.
I also enjoy writing about political subjects; being a student, I like to explore how world issues are reflected on campuses around the U.S. As a South Asian woman, my background tends to shape my perspective and gives me a unique understanding on social and political issues. I’m interested in how immigrant communities in NYC are mobilizing to get their voices heard and have more say in local government. I hope to be a voice for my community in the media world.
