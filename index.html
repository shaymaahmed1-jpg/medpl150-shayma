<p> I am an aspiring writer and reporter. In my writing, I tend to focus on social issues and injustices. I like to analyze trends and hot topics that are prevalent on social media to find content for my writing. As a college student, I find it interesting to explore how world issues affect campuses around the U.S.  </p>
